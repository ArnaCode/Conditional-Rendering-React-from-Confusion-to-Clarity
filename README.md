# Conditional Rendering in React

Conditional rendering allows us to build dynamic user interfaces that change based on state, props, data availability, or any condition. Whether itâ€™s toggling UI elements, showing different layouts for logged-in vs. logged-out users, or loading different components based on application state, understanding conditional rendering is essential for creating interactive and robust React applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this video, you will be able to:

- Understand the fundamentals of conditional rendering in React.
- Apply multiple techniques for conditionally rendering components (logical AND, ternaries, if-else blocks).
- Integrate state management using React hooks (useState, useEffect) to control rendered output.
- Use TypeScript to provide better structure and safety without over-annotating.
- Leverage Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring clean and maintainable UI code.
- Explore advanced conditional rendering patterns, including asynchronous data handling, responsive conditions, Suspense boundaries, transitions, and compound components.

## Examples

- Basic Toggle Visibility
- Conditional Rendering Based on Authentication State
- Rendering Lists Conditionally
- Form Validation Feedback
- Conditional Rendering Based on Component Props
- Conditional Rendering with Suspense and Fallbacks
- Conditional Rendering Based on Window Size (Custom Hook)
- Conditional Rendering with Async Data Fetching (Loading, Error, Data States)
- Conditional Rendering with CSS Transitions
- Compound Components and Conditional Rendering

## Taking a Look at the Examples

After forking or downloading it from GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Open with your favorite code editor

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```
npm install
```

3. Start the development server by running the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

Happy Coding and Learning ðŸ˜Š
